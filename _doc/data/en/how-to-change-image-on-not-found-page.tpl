<h2>Change the Cat Image on the Not Found Error Page</h2>

<p>You can change the image by replacing the existing one in <a href="https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/blob/master/templates/system/modules/error/themes/base/img/page-not-found.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">templates/system/modules/error/themes/base/img/page-not-found.png</a></p>
<p>Then, you will have to <a href="{site_url}en/how-to-clear-caches">clear the static cache</a> from the admin panel (Admin Panel -> Tool -> Caches -> Caches Manager).</p>
<p>Finally, you might also have to clear your browser's cache if it still caches the previous image.</p>
