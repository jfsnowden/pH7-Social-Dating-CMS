<h2>How to remove the "Powered by" link in the footer</h2>

<p>Since <a href="http://ph7cms.com/ph7cms-10-released/">pH7CMS v10</a>, you can disable the footer branding link from your admin panel.</p>
<p>Go to your <strong>Admin Panel</strong> (generally <em>mysite.com/admin123</em>) -> Settings -> General -> <strong>Show "Powered By" link</strong></p>

<p class="bold">Although you can do it..., we don't really see why you would hide the branding.</p>
